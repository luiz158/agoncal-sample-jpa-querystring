# Sample - JPA - Query String

## Purpose of this sample

The purpose of this sample is to show you how to display the JPQL and/or SQL query String of a JPA 2.0 Criteria Query. JPA 2.0 specifies a typed safe criteria API, i.e, a way to build a JPQL query using an API instead of a String. The problem is that JPA doesn't specify a standard way of getting the built String of a Criteria API, so each implementation has it own proprietary API.

## Compile and test

Being Maven centric, you can compile and test the samples with `mvn clean compile` or `mvn clean test`.
